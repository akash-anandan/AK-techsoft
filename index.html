    <h2>introduction</h2>
    <p>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities that are dedicated to the process of
        creating, designing, deploying and supporting software . Software itself is the set of instructions or programs
        that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable.

        The goal of software development is to create a product that meets user needs and business objectives in an
        efficient, repeatable and secure way. Software developers, programmers and software engineers develop software
        through a series of steps called the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Artificial intelligence-powered
        tools and generative AI are increasingly used to assist software development teams in producing and testing
        code.

        Modern enterprises often use a DevOps model—a set of practices, protocols and technologies used to accelerate
        the delivery of higher-quality applications and services. DevOps teams combine and automate the work of software
        development and IT operations teams. DevOps teams focus on continuous integration and continuous delivery
        (CI/CD), processes that use automation to deploy small, frequent updates to continually improve software
        performance.

        So much of modern life—business or otherwise—relies on software solutions. From the phones and computers used
        for personal tasks or to complete our jobs, to the software systems in use at the utility companies that deliver
        services to homes, businesses and more. Software is ubiquitous and software development is the crucial process
        that brings these applications and systems to life.

    <li>The software development process is the approach to developing, and delivering software applications. This
        process might include improving design and product management by splitting the work into smaller steps or
        processes.Software is a set of programs having specific functions that are designed to work according to human
        needs. The Software Development Process includes different steps in an organized way to form a software product.
        In this article, we are going to learn about Software Development Process, their needs, the purpose of the
        software development process, steps of the software development process, approaches of Software Development, and

        <p>The software development process is the approach to developing, and delivering software applications. This
            process might include improving design and product management by splitting the work into smaller steps or
            processes.</p>
        <h1>Requirment gathering</h1>
        <p>In this step, the team of software developers holds discussions with various stakeholders from the problem
            domain and provides as much as information possible for the requirement of the software product. The
            requirements can be of different forms like user requirements, system requirements, functional requirements,
            etc.</p>
        <h1>Faesibility Study</h1>
        <p>After requirement gathering, with the help of many algorithms, the team analyzes that if the software can be
            designed to fulfil all requirements of the user and also analyzes if the project is financially, practically
            and technologically feasible for the organization or not.</p>
        <h1>System anaiysis (A planning phases )</h1>
        <p>Software developer decides on a roadmap for their plan and tries to bring up the best software model stable
            for the project. System analysis may also include understanding product limitations and identifying and
            addressing the impact of the project on the organization. The project analyzes the scope of the project and
            plans the resources accordingly.</p>
        <h1>Software design</h1>
        <p>Software design whole knowledge of requirements and analyses are taken together to plan up design of software
            products. It takes input from the user and information gathered in the requirement-gathering phase. It gives
            output in the form of logical and physical design.</p>
        <h1>coding</h1>
        <p>This step is also known as the programming phase. The implementation of software design starts in the form of
            writing code in suitable programming and developing error-free programs efficiently.</p>
        <h1>testing</h1>
        <p>Software testing is done while coding by the testers' developing team members. Testing is done at various
            levels i.e. module testing, product testing, program testing and user-end testing.</p>
        <h1>integration</h1>
        <p>After writing all the codes for the software such as frontend, backend, and databases, The software is
            integrated with libraries, databases and other programs.</p>
        <h1>implementation</h1>
        <p>In this step, the software product is finally ready to be installed on the user's machine. Software is tested
            for profitability, integration, adaptability, etc</p>
        <h1>Operation and Maintenance</h1>
        <p>This phase confirms the software operations in terms of more efficiency and fewer errors. If required, the
            users are trained or aided with the documentation on how to operate the software and how they keep the
            software operational. This software is maintained timely by updating the code according to the changes
            taking place in the user and environment or technology.</p>
